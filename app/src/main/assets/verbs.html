			<td class="c3">A verb that is already transitive becomes doubly so,
			as it takes a meaning of "make do" or "make become", so the meaning
			could be "to make one learn" i.e. "to teach". This form reflects
			meaning in three ways:
			<ol>
					<li>Intensity of the verb (repetition or the energy in which the action is performed).</li>
					<li>He made himself do (to make himself).</li>
					<li>Causative (to make another do).</li>
			</ol>
			In the intensity example on the right, the form of the verb shows the
			intensity and the repetition of the action, i.e. she closed all the doors
			and bolted them.

			<td class="c3">This form implies that there is someone or

			<ol>
				<li>Causative ("to be") as an active participle.</li>
				<li>Mutual action (he made him do the same).</li>
			</ol>
			In the causative example on the right, the active participle is
			derived from form I
			<span class="r1">SH</span>-a-<span class="r2">H</span>-i-<span class="r3">D</span>-a
			"to witness" or "to be present",
			which also occurs in the same verse. So here it is almost as if to
			say "he caused himself to witness".
			<p>In the second example, the verb "fight" requires someone to be
			fought with, and so the action is mutual.

			<td class="c3">This pattern is similar to form II in
			that it makes intransitive verbs transitive, and transitive verbs
			doubly so. This form has the meaning of:
			<ol>
				<li>He made himself do or perform an action.</li>
				<li>A reflexive causative, i.e. he made himself do something transformative to a place or a state.</li>
			</ol>
			In the first example on the right, he made himself "destroy the crops".
			<p>
			In the second example, the verb is causative, so that he made himself
			"want to harm".
			<p>
			In the third example, he was not of the losers before this action of killing,
			but now was transformed into that state.

			form 2 verb, the
			t-a-<span class="r1">F</span>-<span class="r2">33</span>-a-<span class="r3">L</span>-a
			form 5 verb is from the point of view of the object of the verb. This

			<p>In the first example on the right,
			<span class="r1">DH</span>-a-<span class="r2">KK</span>-a-<span class="r3">R</span>-a

			<p>In the second example, the verb here is
			t-a-<span class="r1">GH</span>-a-<span class="r2">YY</span>-a-<span class="r3">R</span>-a
			"to undergo change", so these rivers in paradise do not undergo any change of

			the action of form 3
			(<span class="r1">F</span>-aa-<span class="r2">3</span>-a-<span class="r3">L</span>-a).
			Notice that as in form 5, this
			is obtained by adding ta- before the verb. Since form 3 implies an
			action done on someone, form 6 implies reciprocity as in the English
			sentence "they looked at each other".
			<p>The subject cannot be singular in this function of the form.
			For example,
			t-a-<span class="r1">K</span>-aa-<span class="r2">T</span>-a-<span class="r3">B</span>-a
			itself would mean "they corresponded
			with each other" (they wrote to each other). Here they support one
			another in this particular action. This usually reflects the meaning
			of:
			<ol>
				<li>Pure mutuality, e.g.
				t-a-<span class="r1">B</span>-aa-<span class="r2">D</span>-a-<span class="r3">L</span>-a
				"he exchanged" takes
				one object, or
				t-a-<span class="r1">3</span>-aa-<span class="r2">W</span>-a-<span class="r3">N</span>-a
				"he became assisting". More than one
				party needs to be involved in this action</li>
				<li>Conative - he made himself be the doer.</li>
				<li>Pretension – he made himself do something, e.g. "He made himself appear to forget".</li>

			<td class="c3">This form expresses submission to an action or effect.
			In the case of an animate being, this is an involuntary submission. The
			form reflects meaning on two levels:
			<ol>
				<li>Reflexive (to let oneself be put through).</li>
				<li>Angentless passive (non-reciprocal of form I).</li>
			</ol>
			In the second example, the verb is
			i-n-<span class="r1">F</span>-a-<span class="r2">T</span>-a-<span class="r3">R</span>-a
			"to be taken apart". In the Quranic sense, the agent of the action is God, as the skies do not split
			without a cause. But here it serves the heaven's submission to be broken apart.
